        <p>
          At the end of 2022, I quit my job as a software engineer to go fulltime into building and scaling
          my own SaaS businesses. In the past, I pursued a double degree in computer science and
          business, interned at big tech companies in Silicon Valley, and competed in over 21
          hackathons for fun. I also had the pleasure of being a part of the first ever in-person cohort of
          buildspace called buildspace sfl.
