          Hi, I’m Dishank — a builder at heart with a passion for turning ideas into scalable, production-ready products.

As a full stack developer and founder, I’ve worked across AI, blockchain, and developer tools. I built Brainer, an AI-powered note-taking app that reached 100+ users on launch, and published system papers sharing how we used OpenAI and custom embeddings to speed up note-taking by over 60%. I also created Sage.AI, an intelligent research explainer that breaks down dense academic papers into interactive summaries, and Vectron, a Rust-based vector database designed for fast ML workloads.

Beyond AI, I’ve ventured into blockchain: recently developed a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, leveraging Bun for high-performance backend tasks and Rust smart contracts to handle token swaps securely.

Previously, I co-founded SneakSupp, a sneaker marketplace built with Next.js, Node.js, and Firebase, and worked as a full stack intern at Unique Data Solution, where I deployed cloud-native apps on AWS that achieved 99.9% uptime.

Along the way, I’ve solved 530+ LeetCode problems, served as Vice-President of SPIE (running workshops for 300+ students), and kept my focus on delivering products that blend solid engineering with real user impact.
